My implimentation of GOAP AI.

Far from perfect, but wowrks alright.
Its here while I prepare it for use with my minecraft bot.

You will need my astar pathfinding library, or something like
it, since GOAP uses astar to make decisions.

There is a test called pirate.  It more-or-less test/demos the
GOAP library.

pygoap is under a rather large rewrite as I prepare it for
usage in large environments.  This includes an environment
modeler and pathfinding, among other things.

That said, it is possible that it won't run at checkout,
at least, for a couple weeks (things move slow here).

Hope you have fun.
