My implimentation of GOAP AI.

Far from perfect, but wowrks alright.
Its here while I prepare it for use with my minecraft bot.

You will need my astar pathfinding library, or something like
it, since GOAP uses astar to make decisions.

There is a test called pirate.  It more-or-less test/demos the
GOAP library.

Hope you have fun.
