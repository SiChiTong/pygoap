this is pygoap v.3
for python 2.x and pygame 1.9



please check out the source for hints on how the library works.  this is under constant rewrite, and i only work on it occasionally.  so needless to say: not stable.

you can watch it work by running "test.py".


many thanks to opengameart.org for providing and hosting the tileset used in the project.  tiles for the map can be found at:
